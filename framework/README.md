# Framework (daily driver)

![qd@fw neofetch](neofetch.png "qd@fw neofetch")

Includes:

- `xmonad` and `xmobar` config
- development environments for several ecosystems, which I access all at once by a `.envrc` in `$HOME`.
- my `$DOOMDIR` declaring my emacs build
- `home-manager` as a module of the flake
